# MessageToCarbon
> 🎨 Get beautiful images of your code in your favorite group of developers on Whatsapp.

## 💭 Description:

<p>
Creating beautiful images with carbon.sh is great, but creating them while chatting on your favorite WhatsApp group of developers is much more amazing.
</p>

## 🕹️ Usage:

<p>
Just by adding three crasis quotes (```) before the code, you will tell messageToCarbon that it should transform that message into an image made in Carbon.sh
</p>

### Example:


```javascript
```const unfold = (f, seed) => {
  const go = (f, seed, acc) => {
    const res = f(seed)
    return res ? go(f, res[1], acc.concat([res[0]])) : acc
  }
  return go(f, seed, [])
};
```

### Output:
<img src="src/carbon.png" alt="Basic example" width="550"/>
